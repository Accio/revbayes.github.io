### About

RevBayes provides an interactive environment for statistical computation in phylogenetics. It is primarily intended for modeling, simulation, and Bayesian inference in evolutionary biology, particularly phylogenetics. However, the environment is quite general and can be useful in any field dealing with complex stochastic models.

RevBayes uses its own language, Rev, which is similar to the language used in R. Like the R language, Rev is designed to support interactive analysis. It supports both functional and procedural programming models, and makes a clear distinction between the two. Rev is also more strongly typed than R.

RevBayes is a probabilistic programming language like [JAGS](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/), [STAN](http://mc-stan.org/), [Edward](http://edwardlib.org/), [PyMC3](http://docs.pymc.io/intro.html), and related software. However, phylogenetic models require inference machinery and distributions that are unavailable in these other tools.

### Core Development Team

RevBayes was designed an developed by [Sebastian HÃ¶hna](http://evol.bio.lmu.de/people/group_leaders/hoehna/index.html), [Fredrik Ronquist](http://www.nrm.se/english/researchandcollections/bioinformaticsandgenetics/staffandcontact/fredrikronquist.9003433.html) and [John P. Huelsenbeck](http://cteg.berkeley.edu/huelsenbeck.html).
The core development team additionally includes [Michael J. Landis](http://mlandis.github.io/), [Bastien Boussau](https://sites.google.com/site/bastienboussau/), [Tracy A. Heath](http://phyloworks.org/), [Nicolas Lartillot](http://lbbe.univ-lyon1.fr/-Lartillot-Nicolas-.html?lang=fr), [Walker Pett](http://willpett.github.io/), and [William Freyman](https://willfreyman.org/).
