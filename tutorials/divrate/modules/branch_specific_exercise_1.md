{% subsection Exercise 1 %}
-  Run an MCMC simulation to estimate the posterior distribution of the speciation rate and extinction rate.
- Visualize the branch-specific rates in `FigTree` and upload two files, one for the speciation rate and for the extinction rate.
- Do you see evidence for rate decreases or increases? What is the general trend?
- Run the analysis using a different number for the expected number of shifts (`EXPECTED_NUM_EVENTS`), *e.g.,* 10 or 20. How do the rates change?
- For the same analysis that you did just now, look in `Tracer` at the `total_num_events`. Write down the mean and the 95% HPD. How does this change with the different settings on `EXPECTED_NUM_EVENTS`?
